\begin_layout Abstract

\change_deleted -468262419 1470075124
In this work we evaluated the improvement in the detection of stress induced
 ischemia achieved by ECG features not commonly measured by cardiologists.
 We evaluated 927 patients recorded during treadmill exercise SPECT following
 the Bruce protocol.
 The patients were labeled in three groups by two experts according to their
 SPECT images as: no ischemia (Ischemic Miocardium (IM)
\begin_inset Formula $<5\%$
\end_inset

), mild ischemia (
\begin_inset Formula $5\%\leq$
\end_inset

IM
\begin_inset Formula $<10\%$
\end_inset

) and moderate/severe ischemia (IM
\begin_inset Formula $\geq10\%$
\end_inset

).
 The features studied were grouped as pretest features, exercise features
 and those proposed in this work.
 Among the features proposed, we included the Q, R, and S wave amplitudes,
 the slopes around each wave, and estimates of the P and T wave widths,
 as well as the QRS complex width.
 We also studied other features related to the ST segment.
 For the detection task, we used logistic regression, while the performance
 was evaluated using k-fold crossvalidation.
 Most discriminant features were selected using a feature selection algorithm
 for two thresholds of ischemia, 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq5\%$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq10\%$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, two models of features were evaluated and compared to those reported
 by Sharir et al.
 obtaining improved performance for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{IM}\geq5\%$
\end_inset

 in Se 77%, Sp 88% and AUC 0.88; while for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{IM}\geq10\%$

, Se 76%, Sp 90% and AUC 0.95.

provides a noninvasive and inexpensive technique to analyze the heart function
 for different cardiac conditions.
 The first task to perform in almost all automatic procedures is the detection
 of heartbeats or QRS complexes, and the subsequent construction of the
 RR interval sequence.
 In the last decades big efforts were made to perform this analysis automaticall
y, and as a result, many algorithms for QRS complex detection were published

\begin_layout Standard
It's clear that almost every algorithm for QRS detection is divided in two
 process: signal processing and decision rules.
 In a preliminary study we evaluated wich of these algotirhms should be
 fully representative for a complete first work as researchers, and for
 being robust and widely used decided to evaluate the Pan and Tompkins algorithm
 of each author of this article against the same implemented in the ECG-kit

\end_inset

.
 Probably the most popular detector is the Pan and Tompkins algorithm, developed
 thirty years ago it remains a common choice because of its simplicity and
 performance.
 It constructs a detection signal based on digital bandpass filter, followed
 by a differentiator, a squaring function and a sliding window integrator.
 The actual detection is performed through adaptive thresholds and decision
 rules.
 On the other hand, other detectors such as 
\emph on
wqrs
\emph default
 uses a similar approach, but the curve length transformation was introduced
 in order to obtain the detection signal.
 Referring to the algorithm based on wavelet transform, it's an implementation
 based on the multiscale approach, amplitude based criteria and the adaptive
 thresholding for each scale of this transform.
 Finally, SQRS is based on the techniques of amplitud threshold, a first
 and second derivative and a stage for digital filtering.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this study was to evaluate two implementations of the Pan and
 Tompkins algorithm comparing their performance to an open source implementation
, evaluated in the public MIT-BIH database 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in order to ensure results reproducibility.

\begin_layout Subsection
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously mentioned, we used the well-known MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database,
 which is a collection of 48 fully annotated half-hour two-lead ECG.
 Each recording was sampled at 360 Hz with a voltage resolution of 11-bit
 over a 10mV range.
 Two or more cardiologists independently annotated each recording and resolved
 the disagreements, generating a reference annotation for each heartbeat
 in the database.
 Four of these 48 records (102, 104, 107, and 217) include paced beats and
 their QRS complexes are not recognized by using commonly methods described
 in the introduction, so we decided not to evaluate our implementation on
 them.
 There are, however, developed pacemaker artifact detectors.

The first stage consist in a band-pass filter in order to attenuete low
 frequencies like P and T waves, attenuate power-line, muscle noise and
 baseline drift.
 In fact, the original Pan and Tompkins band-pass filter consist in the
 cascade of a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter to achieve the goal.
 Using the technic for integer coefficents, they design
\change_inserted -468262419 1470064329
ed
\change_unchanged
 a band-pass filter with bandwidth about 5Hz-12Hz, where the poles are located
 to cancel the zeros on the unit circle of the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the low-pass filter's transfer function is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H(z)=\frac{\left(1-z^{-6}\right){}^{2}}{\left(1-z^{-1}\right)^{2}}\label{eq:lpf}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This transfer function has a gain of 
\begin_inset Formula $20log_{10}(36)=31,126dB$

 and a delay of 5 samples, that it can be easily obtained by plotting both
 amplitude response and group delay of

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, the high-pass filter's transfer function is implementated by a subtraction
 of a a low-pass filter from an all-pass filter.
 The transfer funcition
\change_deleted -468262419 1470064360
 for this
\change_unchanged
 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that

has a gain of 1 and a delay of 16 samples.

Finally, when cascaded both low-pass and high-pass filters, the transfer
 function is

The slope of the R wave by itself is not enough to identify a QRS event,
 so the output from the squaring stage is filtered with a moving window
 integration in order to add all points within the window.
 The size of the windows's width was originally determined empirically with
 a value of 150 milliseconds, representing N = 54 samples or data points
 for a signal sampled at 360Hz.
 With this value, we ensure that all possibles QRS complexes completely
 fit in the choosen window.

 it to the signal peak level.
 When a peak exceeds the highest threshold of the first set, or the highest
 threshold in the search-back situation, is categorized as a QRS peak.
 The lower threshold in both set is used when no QRS is detected in a certain
 time and is necessary to look back in time.
 Finally, a peak must be recognized in both the moving window integrator
 and bandpass output.

The results for boths algorithms are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Performance"

\end_inset

.
 Algorithm 1 was implemented by Juan Ignacio Robledo and the algorithm 2
 was implemented by Juan Ignacio Bianchetti.
 Both were tested in all records of MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database with the
 exception of records 102, 104, 107 and 217.
 The following criteria were used to present the results: lead with both
 PV+ (predictive value positive) y SENS (sensibility) maximun, if maximum
 were not in the same lead, it is presented MLII.
 If MLII was not an available lead, the first entry in order of appearance
 was chosen.
 Both algorithms use the same criteria to show its results.

In this work we presented a model of features for ischemia detection in
 EST, based on three groups: pretest, exercise and a set of proposed measurement
s calculated in ECG recordings of conventional analog bandwidth.
 The proposed group of features is the main methodological contribution
 with respect to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sharir2012"

\end_inset

.
 These features were calculated in most of the cardiac cycle in order to
 measure the effect of stress-induced ischemia.
 Some of the features were studied in previous works in the context of ischemia
 detection 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ellestad2003stress,Pueyo2008"

\end_inset

, while others as 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{Z}^{\mathrm{X}}$
\end_inset

 were successfully used for heartbeat classification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Llamedo11"

\end_inset

.
 The performance improvement of each feature was analyzed with an SFFS algorithm
, obtaining two models, one for IM
\begin_inset Formula $\geq5\%$
\end_inset

 and the other for IM
\begin_inset Formula $\geq10\%$
\end_inset

, which maximized the AUC calculated in a crossvalidated fashion.
 We chose these evaluation approach to avoid obtaining a model too overfitted
 to the data, as could happen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sharir2012"

\end_inset

.
 Of the features included in the models, measurements around the Q wave
 seem to be discriminant (
\begin_inset Formula $x(k_{\mathrm{Q}})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\mathrm{Q}}^{-}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\mathrm{R}}^{\mathrm{Q}}$
\end_inset

), this could be related with the fact that the first region affected by
 ischemia is subendocardial 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ellestad2003stress"

\end_inset

.
 The terminal slope of the QRS complex ( 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\mathrm{-}}^{\mathrm{S}}$
\end_inset

 ) measured in PCA2 or integrated with the SFT strategy were also included.
 These features together with those related to the duration of the ventricular
 repolarization should be further studied to understand its relation with
 stress-induced ischemia.
 The duration of the QRS complex (
\begin_inset Formula $k_{Z}^{\mathrm{QRS}}$
\end_inset

) is well known to be affected by ischemia, as well as the level of the
 ST segment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ellestad2003stress"

\end_inset

.
 With respect to the high frequency components of the WT QRS complex measured
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{\mathrm{WTX}}$
\end_inset

, only scales 3 and 4 were included, despite other scales of higher frequency
 were available for the feature selection.
 An aspect to be further studied is the importance that each feature has
 within the model.
 Respect to the calculation of the features as a ratio respect rest or two
 separate features, both strategies were selected.
 As a consequence, further experimentation is required to know which features
 benefit from each strategy.
 Finally, it would be interesting to study if features similar to HFQRS,
 with good performance reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sharir2012"

\end_inset

, could contribute to the obtained models.
 For this purpose we would need ECG recordings with an analog bandwidth
 up to 250 Hz.

As can be seen in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Performance"

\end_inset

, the crossvalidated performance is more conservative, but probably more
 representative of the actual performance of a classifier.
 According to the ROC curve shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ROC-curves-for"

\end_inset

, the most challenging detection problem is for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{IM}\geq5\%$
\end_inset

, for the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{IM}\geq10\%$
\end_inset

 the final model performs extremely well, a symptom that the model could
 be too overfitted, probably because of the scarcity of severe ischemia
 patients in the cohort analyzed.
 However, it is necessary to study how these models performance (and the
 reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Sharir2012"

\end_inset

) generalize to other databases in order to validate the performance improvement
 presented in this work.
