\begin_layout Abstract
Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause most of the deaths.
 Taking data from the Health Worldwide Organization, 17.3 millions people
 have died because of CVD in 2008, therefore, advances in this area could
 improve people's life.
 Taking that into account, the proposal of this work is to develop an open
 software to analyse the input of any electrocardiogram and give as feedback,
 a detailed report and also a detailed view of the ecg signals, blood pressure
 and plethysmographic.
 Creating an open web software will give ,to any user, the chance of studying
 ecg signal without being an expert.
 Furthermore, any researcher around the world could use this application
 to compare their results with the Web Application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are in the present the first cause of death
 in the developed countries.
 Probably the biggest challenge of the modern cardiology is the sudden cardiac
 death, in several aspects related to ventricular arrhythmias.
 It is well known that the study of arrhythmias requires careful inspection
 of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of several hours length.
 To this respect, the asistance of automatic algorithms may represent an
 increase in the number of patients analyzed, and the quality of the variables
 derived from those ECG recordings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the last decades, the relation between the cardiology and computer
 technology has become closer, and as long as this relation keeps evolving,
 cardiologists, scientists and people will be benefit.
 Computers helps cardiology in different areas such as data storage, surgical
 procedures, knowledge and diagnostic sharing .
 In this case, computerized methods can help to detect cardiovascular diseases
 with a high degree of assistance.
 The ECG is a routine and inexpensive methodology in the clinical practice.
 After the interpretation of the ECG, cardiologists can detect and analyze
 CVD's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ECG kit, is a toolbox which has tools for reading, processing and presenting
 results for the ECG.
 One of the main features, is the possibility to use several algorithms
 for ECG processing, such us Algorithms from Physionet’s, QRS detectors,
 Wavedet ECG delineator, and other scritps for inspecting, correcting and
 reporting all these results.
 The kit also implements a recording interface which allows processing several
 ECG formats, such as HL7-aECG, MIT, ISHNE, HES, Mortara, and AHA, of arbitrary
 recording size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The toolbox, runs under Matlab, therefore it is necessary to have enough
 knowledge about MATLAB before using the ECG kit.
 In this project, we want to remove this restriction and create an open
 world wide software that could be used by any cardiologist around the world
 just using their browsers.
 Furthermore, an open application, could give us the chance of colecting
 cardiovascular information about different people around the world.

Yo acá haría una referencia a lo que ya hemos desarrollado del ecg-kit,
 qué particularidades tiene, qué tipo de algoritmos ya tiene implementado
 y qué análisis se podrían hacer, hacé una primera versión si querés.

Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objective of the application is to give to any cardiologist around
 the world, the possibility of getting an automatic analysis from the ECG.
 The results will be shown in a report, and it will be also possible to
 see the ECG in an interactive ECG diagram.
 Every cardiologist that wants to use this application, will need the browser
 or any phone with Android or iOS, it won't be necessary to have any other
 additional software.
 Therefore.
 this application removes the need of buying any expensive software, it
 will be just necessary to have the minimun knowledge to use either a computer
 or a phone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This software will be integrated by the following main components, ECG-D3
 library, front end web application, backend, and Matlab core.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
ECG-D3 library
\series default
: D3 [1] is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.
 In web development, it is the most important library to create graphs.
 During our research, we realized there is no any big open library to create
 ECG graphs for javascript.
 Therefore, one of the main tasks in this project will be to create an open
 library for the graphics of the ECG using D3.
 The idea is to create the library for the needs of this project, but it
 will be open on github [2], therefore any user around the world will have
 the possiblity of increase the functionality of it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Front-end
\series default
: this component will handle the interaction with the user.
 The main focus here, is to create an intuive interface to upload the files
 and, to present the ECG-D3 graph with the report of the results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Back-end: 
\series default
REST api.
 It will handle the requests between front-end and the core algorihtms implented
 in Matlab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Matlab core
\series default
: implements the algorithms Wavedet, gqrs, wqrs, Pan and Tompkins, ECGpuwave,
 EP limited, to detect the location of each heartbeat (QRS detection).
 After detecting the QRS, the second task consist on running the peak detection
 over pulsatile signals such as arterial blood pressure (ABP) or plethysmographi
c (PPG).
 The task uses two algorithms to achieve pulse detection, and as in QRS
 detection, it is possible to use any of them.
 The last task, will be the ECG heartbeat classification, that follows the
 EC-57 AAMI recommendation classifying heartbeats into four classes: N normal
 S supraventricular V ventricular F fusion of normal and ventricular.
 Those values will be presented to the user.

Learning Purposes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a patient goes to the Emergency Room, the ECG is the first procedure
 to be done.
 Sometimes, in seconds, doctors need to understand what is happening with
 the patient.
 Here, have enough practise reading ECGs, could be the difference to recover
 a patient in a risk situation.
 It is clear the importance of knowing how to read an ECG properly, just
 in a few minutes and that is why this is one of the first things doctors
 needs to learn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saying that, we belive that the application could be also used for learning
 purposes.
 Students can use the application to compare their results with the application
 results.
 Furthermore, not only this app could be used by students but also by medicine
 teachers who want to use an interactive tool.
 The application will be also integrated with Physionet [4] databases, therefore
, it will be possible for students to use the app with enough ECG examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion and Future releases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it was mentioned before, in a nearly feature the application will give
 the option to store the recordings uploaded by the cardiologist.
 Doing that, it will be possible to store recordings of real ECG to analyse
 and understand CVD.
 Using that information, it will be possible to run different analysis regarding
, regions, ages, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that there isn't any open application like this
 on internet.
 The code will be available on githb for  and any developer, cardiologist,
 or any person who wants to see how the app was done,
